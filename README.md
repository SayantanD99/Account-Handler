# Account Handler

A Simple Menu-Driven Java Program. 

It is designed to handle basic transactions of an account just like an account management application.

It can easily perform basic withdrawal and deposit actions and also starting from creating an account at first.

Also giving the user options for opening a desired type of account.

A sample output for the menu is provided in the repo.

Do share if you have any questions or if you have any suggestions about the code.

I would be really happy.

Thank You !
